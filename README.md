# Automatisation of Tasks with Rake (Ruby)

Project Description: Task-Automation-with-Rake

This project uses Rake, a Ruby tool, to automate and simplify repetitive and maintenance tasks in software development. Through this project, examples of automation techniques for common tasks are provided, such as code compilation, temporary file cleanup, test execution, and the implementation of custom scripts to improve efficiency and reduce manual errors.

Key Features:

    Custom task definitions for specific workflows.
    Dependency management between tasks, allowing for structured and correctly ordered execution.
    Automation of complex processes in both development and production environments, from environment setup to final deployment.
    Ease of configuration and customization: tasks can be tailored to various automation needs.

This project is ideal for developers seeking to improve productivity and efficiency in repetitive tasks, minimizing errors and ensuring consistency in their workflows.

This project demonstrates how to automate tasks using Rake in Ruby.

## Tasks

- `rake my_tasks:example_task`: Prints a message.
- `rake my_tasks:create_directory`: Creates a new directory called `my_directory`.
- `rake my_tasks:cleanup`: Cleans up temporary files.
